        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>Why would we create <Frantic/> and release it into the world? It seems so ripe for abuse - to revoke a commonly accepted right to delete.</p>
        <p>We made <Frantic/> because we believe it will do more good than harm. The platform has incredible potential in preserving cases of abuse, where the abuser has the power to redact their messages. The platform also does work to resist censorship, where moderators &amp; admins run wild and hide discussions that need to be had, discussions they don't like. It can even be used for preservation of user generated content, to counter linkrot, to hold accountable.</p>
        <p>And sure, it can be used to stalk people, to abuse them, but ultimately all we do is take and store screenshots in a modern, more powerful way. <i><Frantic/> is screenshots for user generated content</i>. It's also like <code>archive.org</code>, who have stored billions of web pages, millions simpily being nothing but someone's profile pages</p>
        <p>We have to assume that there is more good than bad in this world, that this tool can help more than it can hurt.</p>
        <p>Our world has many beautiful things, but this new world lets them go so quick. <Frantic/> gives you a chance to slow down, to smell the flowers, and to identify things that threaten them.</p>
